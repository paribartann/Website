                            I had never been this lonely
                        <br />
                            never felt so left out
                        <br />
                            nowhere to go and no one to talk to
                        <br />
                            Felt like, I was my only friend
                        <br />
                            I thought I began to understand life
                        <br />
                            its bitter truth, bitter reality
                        <br />
                            and its phonies with sugared flattery
                        <br />
                            its tendency to engage people
                        <br />
                            and put a permanent scar in people’s heart
                        <br />
                            But now…..
                        <br />
                            Slowly, the scars feel like designed tattoos
                        <br />
                            I saw honesty on flatteries
                        <br />
                            people are not only phonies
                        <br />
                            life doesn’t only tangle you!
                        <br />
                            Life isolates you
                        <br />
                            to teach you things beyond grasp
                        <br />
                            to let you explore
                        <br />
                            to enable you to
                        <br />
                            find tranquility within your soul
                        <br />
                            This isolation has been a great teacher
                        <br />
                            it taught me to stand on my feet
                        <br />
                            Distinguish fake from genuine
                        <br />
                            it created a new me
                        <br />
                            to be able to survive in this world.
