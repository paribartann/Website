                Life has the tendency to knock you down
                <br/>

                    Kick you repeatedly   
                    <br/>
                    Test your patience in the face of adversity
                    <br/>
                    Now it’s upto you 
                    <br/>
                    Whether you choose to back down or to rise up
                    <br/>
                    But I chose the latter
                    <br/>
                    If life demands changes
                    <br/>
                    I am moving on
                    <br/>
                    If life is trying to teach
                    <br/>
                    I am learning from the mistakes
                    <br/>
                    At times,
                    <br/>
                    Hard work doesn’t pay off
                    <br/>
                    But no way has it gone in vain
                    <br/>
                    It waits and waits asking for more time
                    <br/>
                    And more patience 
                    <br/>
                    Making you believe that everything
                    <br/>
                    Happens for a reason
                    <br/>
                    So here I am standing braver than ever
                    <br/>
                    Not fearing to fail in the course of life
                    <br/>
                    Not losing hope at all in times of despair
                    <br/>
                    But embarking upon a new journey 
                    <br/>
                    That might make me fall
                    <br/>
                    But I will rise again.
